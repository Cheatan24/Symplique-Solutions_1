Below are the Steps we can follow for the Cost Optimization Challenge :-

Step 1:-Archive Old Records: Move records older than three months to Azure Blob Storage to reduce the size and cost of your Cosmos DB.

Step 2:-Create a Hybrid Access Layer: Develop a service that can retrieve data from both Cosmos DB and Blob Storage without changing your existing APIs.

Step3:-Update Read Logic: Adjust your read operations to first check Cosmos DB. If the data isn't there, then fetch it from Blob Storage.

Step4:-Automate Archiving: Set up a scheduled task to regularly move old records from Cosmos DB to Blob Storage.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Detailed Implement : -
Step 1: Identify and Archive Old Records
Create a function to move records older than three months to Azure Blob Storage.

Step 2: Implement a Hybrid Storage Access Layer
Create a service to fetch records from both Cosmos DB and Blob Storage.

Step 3: Update the Read Logic
Modify your existing read logic to use the BillingRecordService.

Step 4: Automate the Archiving Process
Set up a scheduled job using Azure Functions or Azure Logic Apps to periodically move old records.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Deployment:-
1. Deploy the archiving function to Azure Functions.
2.Deploy the hybrid storage access layer as part of your existing service.
3.Schedule the archiving function to run periodically using Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions Timer Trigger.
